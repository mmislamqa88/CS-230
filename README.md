The Gaming Room was a flexible application game producer with prior success. To make the game available across multiple stages and
devices, the client required to develop an online version of its current Android application.
I have included all the important areas for the client's consideration,
for example, the host operating system (OS), memory management and capacity the executive's
arrangements on the servers, the API system, security, and the advantages of employing
serverless engineering to dispatch the item. I also provided the benefits of Clouds.

I have examined different models of UML and outlined the best one and explained the beneficials in development. 
This assisted in the creation of concise classes with direct approaches that exploited the
aberrant style of other parts to create a flawless model.

The section examining well-known operating systems (for instances, Macintosh, Windows, and
Linux). The major client-side concern is the internet browser, as it is the
primary engine that runs the program for the client. I also investigated between
operating systems for online agreements yielded limited knowledge. Operating system
preference for certain applications (for example, Windows to Edge, Mac to Safari, and so on)
might be explored further to see if non-supported apps provide specialized.

The client's primary considerations while developing apps are speed and instinct (for
example convenience). A customer may continue to use the application if they can live without
the look, but they will quit the site if the usefulness is ambiguous or sluggish. Client demands
are important since, as the item's customer, they represent a significant source of money for the
client.

Ultimately, my goal should be Understanding Requirements, Identifying Stakeholders, Defining Use Cases/User Stories, Conceptual Design
Detailed Design, Prototyping, Iterative Development, Testing, Documentation, Feedback and Improvement. 
I will apply above all the points during my designs.
